# 🧠 Teachable Machine Image Classifier

An image classification project using a pre-trained model from [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), deployed and tested in Google Colab.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `keras_model.h5` — Pre-trained Keras model exported from Teachable Machine.  
- `labels.txt` — Text file containing class labels.  
- `my_image.jpg` — Sample image used for prediction.  
- `classifier.ipynb` — (Optional) Jupyter Notebook for running the model.
